# ViewingLighting-Shading

I have learned how to apply perspective projection along with per vertex and per fragment lighting.

## Tasks are as follows
1. Generateing the geometry of an approximate sphere by tetrahedron subdivision.
2. Object related controls:

    a. Decrease/increase the number of tetrahedron subdivisions through buttons.
  
    b. Change the diffuse color coefficients of the surface material using the sliders
  
    c. Beta: Change the shininess coefficient in the specular component of the shading equation.
  
3. Camera related controls: Apply PERSPECTIVE projection.

    a. FOVY: Change the field of view angle (in degrees) in perspective projection.
  
    b. Camera position X, Y, Z: Change the camera position (eye point).  
  
4. Lighting related controls:

   a. Change the light position through sliders.
  
   b. Shading type: Change the shading type through a menu. Options of the menu are:  
  
       i.  Gouraud: Perform Gouraud (per vertex) shading.
    
       ii. Phong: Perform Phong (per fragment) shading.
    
       iii.Wireframe: Draw the wireframe representation of the sphere.
    
## Model 

This is the final model.
